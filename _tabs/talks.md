"Emre Süren, chef på Hacker Lab, en del av Cybercampus på Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan i Stockholm, får se vårt material med rapporten över intrångsförsök på internetforumet med militära hemligheter. Han kan inte utifrån handlingarna dra slutsatsen att någon lyckats hämta ut information därifrån. Men i rapporten finns ett intrång som sticker ut, tycker han. ”Exploited Host”, står det vid ett angrepp som är daterat oktober 2015. Enligt honom betyder det angriparen har kommit in på sajten vid minst ett tillfälle. Det här visar direkt och tydligt att den här enheten har blivit äventyrad av utomstående. En angripare har kommit in på sajten, säger Emre Süren på Hacker Lab."

Cybercampus Sverige had the pleasure of hosting representatives from a government entity at the Hacking Lab. Our researcher, Emre Süren, demonstrated an attack involving the compromise of a fully updated smartphone. The scenario illustrated the dangers of phishing apps on app stores, which allow attackers direct access to smartphones, the ease of exploiting mobile applications developed without security considerations, the process of guessing passwords that appear to meet secure password policies, the risks of connecting to rogue Wi-Fi networks which expose open services to attackers, and the issue of routers with backdoors enabling attackers to infiltrate networks meant to be secure.

"Studenterna som Ny Teknik träffar har bakgrund från olika ingenjörsutbildningar på KTH, berättar Emre Süren, som forskar om sårbarheter i it-system, med fokus på uppkopplade internet of things-enheter. Han ansvarar också för labbet för etisk hackning på KTH. Vi försöker rekrytera blivande forskare bland våra studenter. Men det är inte vårt enda mål med utbildningen utan vi vill också förbereda studenterna för ett yrkesliv it-säkerhetsbranschen, säger Emre Süren. Nu är tanken att Cybercampus ska bli arenan där akademin och den privata it-säkerhetsbranschen ska kunna mötas under mer formella, strukturerade former. Fördelarna med den typen av utbyte av kunskap och information är stor, enligt forskaren Emre Süren. Vi hoppas kunna fördjupa samarbetet mellan kommersiella it-säkerhetsbolag och forskarvärlden. Inom industrin vill du kanske granska tio spår inom it-säkerhet för att sedan välja ut ett och fördjupa sig i det. Men inom akademin kan vi gå djupare in på fem eller tio intressanta spår parallellt, och sedan jämföra och sortera ut lösningen som är mest intressant. Det är en win-win: Vi skulle kunna ta del av omfattande data som it-säkerhetsbolagen samlar in, och de kan få ta del av vår forskning, fortsätter han."
